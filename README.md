# Rereremind

### It is an app that allows you to systematically and easily receive notifications for important reminders.<br>

The chatbot will then ask, "When would you like to be reminded?"<br>
Users can easily specify the time using text, such as "today," "tomorrow at 5 PM," "the day after tomorrow," or "2025/12/25 at 11:00."<br>
<br>
The reminder time can also be extended if needed.<br>
